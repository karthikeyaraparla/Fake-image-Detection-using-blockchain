# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

4. Start local blockchain:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

5. Deploy contract (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```
